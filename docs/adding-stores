# Adding Stores
## Objectives
- This document details the process for adding new entries to the project's list of Featured Bookstores.

- This document is intended as a reference for the project's contributors to add entries into the database. If you would like to generate a bookstore entry for the site, please post an issue on github. The process herein will be handled by our team.  

## Background
- The project's data is stored in a MongoDB database hosted on mlabs.com.
- Information for setting up and connecting the app to a database is presented in the README under "Install and Usage".
- For any questions related to adding stores to the project, please ask for help by creating an issue on github or contacting Vernon @ vernon.lillies@gmail.com .

## Tools

- Featured stores are currently added using Postman. Postman is a tool for building and making API request and is available at https://www.getpostman.com/

## Schema

- Featured stores follow the BookstoreSchema detailed in backend/models/bookstore.js and presented below.

```JavaScript
{
  dateAdded: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  name: String,
  summary: String,
  review: String,
  thumbnail: String,
  images: [String],
  url: String,
  telephone: String,
  amenities: {

  },
  coordinates: {long: Number, lat: Number}
}

```
 - The fields of the schema are detailed in the following section.

### Schema Fields

- `dateAdded` : An automatically generated field recording the date the entry is made. `NOTE` : This field is automatically generated and should be omitted when posting new entries.

- `name` : A string containing the name of the bookstore.

- `summary` : A string of 100 characters or less with a short description of the bookstore.

- `review` : A string containing a full review of the bookstore. The majority of the content should be placed within this field.  The content of this section should be __formatted in Markdown__ and is rendered using the "react-remarkable" package.   

- `thumbnail` : A string containing the path to the images. Typically, this should be the first image of the series. Please consult the "Adding Images" section for detailed information on including images. `ex: 'img/dq/dq_1'`

- `images` : An array of strings containing the path to the images. Please consult the "Adding Images" section for detailed information on including images. `ex: ['img/dq/dq_1', 'img/dq/dq_2', '...']`

- `url` : A string containing the bookstores website url. This fields can be left blank if no website exists.

- `telephone` : A string containing the store's telephone number. Please format the telephone number based on the location of the store and following the national conventions for writting telephone numbers detailed on wikipedia ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_conventions_for_writing_telephone_numbers)) .

- `amenities` : A series of Booleans detailing the amenities available at the bookstore. These fields default to false therefore false fields can be omitted.

- `social` : A series of strings containing the URLs of the bookstores social media pages. Empty fields should be left blank.

- `postalAddress` : A series of strings containing the stores complete address. The sub-fields are detailed below:

  - `addressCountry`: A string containing the full name of the country the store is located in.

  - `addressRegion` : A string containing the full name of the region the store is located in. This could represent a State or a Province.

  - `addressLocality` : A string containing the full name of the locality the store is located in. In North-America, this would typically represent a city.

  - `postalCode` : A string containing the stores postal code.

  - `streetAddress` : A string containing the stores street address.

- `coordinates`: An object containing the bookstores geographical coordinates, where long (short for longitude) is a number representing the east(+) or west(-) angle and lat (short for latitude) is a number representing the north(+) or south(-) angle. Geographical coordinates can be found using google maps by placing a custom marker on the map close to the bookstores location. Care should be taken to place these coordinates in the correct order with the correct symbol. With google maps, the coordinates are displayed in the reverse order.  

## Adding Images

- This sections details the current process for adding images to the project:


- Create a new directory in `public/img`. The directory should be given a meaningful name based on an abbreviation of the bookstores name. For example, images related to a store called "Drawn and Quarterly" may be placed within a folder named "dq".

- Name each image with sequential numbers prefixed by the folder name and an underscore. For example, the first two images for "Drawn and Quarterly" may be named dq_1 and dq_2.

- `Note` : The public portions of the path should be omitted when references the images in the thumbnail and images fields. Please refer to the examples in the previous section.


## Adding stores

- New entries are added to the project by creating a post request to the https://the-travel-shelf.herokuapp.com/api/bookstores/ endpoint. This can be achieve by using a tool like _Postman_ as detailed in the tools section of this document.

- The content of the entry should be included in the _body_ of the _post reuqest_ as a _json_ object following the _schema_ detailed in the schema section of this document.

- A copy of the content should be saved to the project as a .json file in the `_posts` directory.

- The following sections describes the process for adding new bookstores using _Postman_

### Posting stores with Postman

- With postman open, create a new `POST` request pointing to https://the-travel-shelf.herokuapp.com/api/bookstores/ .

- Place your Content in the body of the request as __raw__ data. An example is presented in the next section.

- A successful entry will return an `OK` response.

- Add images directly to the project as detailed in the sections above.

- Please save a copy of the data in the projects `_post` directory as a .json file. This will make it easy for entries to be modified and resubmitted.

### Example

- An example for the store _Drawn and Quarterly_ is presented in this section.

```json

{
  "name": "Drawn and Quarterly",
  "summary": "Montréal and the French language are inextricably linked. You cannot have Quebecois without the city, and you cannot imagine the city without the pervasive French language.",
  "review": "Montréal and the French language are inextricably linked. You cannot have Quebecois without the city, and you cannot imagine the city without the pervasive French language. This was not always the case. The city was once the center of English Canadian influence, and the Quebecois overtook Quebecers as the primary population in the city only after centuries of being delegated as secondary citizens and backcountry yokels. Today, both French and English are spoken in the city, bilingually by most of the population. The richer neighborhoods are still largely Anglophone (although almost always described as anglophone, and not English speaking).\n\nHowever, because of the size of the French speaking population, there is a surfeit of English-language-focused independent bookstores. The Word, Westcott Books, Ascott (TK) a few in Rosemont. And, hidden in the hip, young, and quickly gentrifying neighborhood of Mile End, past the Jewish bookstores serving the large Hasidic community and a block up from the famous Montreal Bagel shops on [St. Viateur](http://www.stviateurbagel.com/), you’ll find [Drawn and Quarterly](http://mtl.drawnandquarterly.com/).\n\nDrawn and Quarterly is the only independent book store in the area that sells new books. The store could be split in two in function and topic - on the left hand, going in, you’ll find new fiction, literary essays, and nonfiction. There’s poetry, drama, plays. On the tables, artfully arranged, you’ll find the same bestsellers as you would from an independent store in New York or London. On the right, you find the _raison detre_ for the shop’s name: rows and rows of graphic novels colorfully aligned pop out to greet you.   \n  \n[Drawn and Quarterly](https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/) is only the store front for a larger business, that of independently publishing graphic novels and comics. Started in 1990 by a 23-year-old Montrealer named Chris Oliveros, it is the [largest publisher in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawn_and_Quarterly), and the store is their only physical space, excepting a brand-new (September, 2017) store for children's literature across the street and a block down. The store was founded in 2008, and now hosts several events a week, as well as having a small stage for workshops on bookbinding and for the occasional band. (For more prominent authors, D&Q often rent out local venues, like they did recently for Zadie Smith).\n\nThe store is small; you can peruse the tables slowly in under ten minutes. However, like all great book shops, this would be a mean and ill-advised feat. The selection is incredible - the essays, some published by Drawn and Quarterly (who occasionally deviate from the drawn medium) and literature section are fantastic, with the normal 15% staff-curated shelf, and the comic and graphic novels practically beg to be opened and perused. Alas, there is a shortage of chairs, and there's no coffee shop. If you want to read a book while doing work over coffee, you can always buy one. Discounts are given for residents of the neighborhood, and there's a monthly book club which is also discounted. The last three months have featured a book on [a Japanese lesbian's experience with loneliness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lesbian_Experience_With_Loneliness), [a retreat by a Korean couple into the country](https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/uncomfortably-happily), and [a young boy's brush with magic and resinking ships](https://www.burntfen.com/the-litt-review/the-unwritten---tommy-taylor-and-the-ship-that-sank-twice/). All of them were fantastically written.\n\nIn short, if you're in the area, pop in, peruse, and don't expect to leave without a book. Or three.",
