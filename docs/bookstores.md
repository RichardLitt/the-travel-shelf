- https://m.facebook.com/librairiesaintjeanbaptiste. (From a friend: Probably my favorite. I have a crush on the kindly Quebec man who runs it. A gathering place for the locals who sit for hours at the tiny cafe bar upstairs and they jabber away in French for hours with my crush. Small cozy reading/working nook next to the bay window where you can watch the world go by below. Great internet. Mostly books in French but they have a small English selection of some good classics. Bought some Joyce and Mark Twain here.)
